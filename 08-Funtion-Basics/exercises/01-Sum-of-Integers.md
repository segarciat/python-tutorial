# 1. Practice: Sum of Natural Numbers

The set of natural number consists of all positive integers.
The sum of the first $n$ natural numbers $1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n$ is

$$
    1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Create a script `sum_of_naturals.py` that implements a function
`sum_up_to()` that, given `n`, computes the sum of the
first `n` natural numbers according to this formula and returns it.

To verify it works, in the same script, call the function somewhere
after the function definition, and display the result.
