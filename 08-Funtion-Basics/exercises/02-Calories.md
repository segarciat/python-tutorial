# 2. Practice: Unit Conversion

Create a script `health.py` that defines a function
`calories()` with three inputs: `fat`, `carbs`, and
`protein` in grams. The function will produce the number
of calories corresponding to these three  quantities.
You may assume there are 4 calories in 1 g of carbs,
4 calories in 1 g of protein, and 9 calories in 1 g
of fat. Then, in the same script, verify your function works
by calling it below the definition in two ways:

- Once using positional arguments
- Once using keyword arguments
