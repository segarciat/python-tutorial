# 3. Practice: The Distance Formula

Create a script `distance_formula.py` that finds the distance
between the points $(7, 4)$ and $(-25, 2)$. Use four variables
for the points: `x0` and `y0` for the first, and `x1` and `y1`
for the second. Store your result in a variable `d`, and display
its value, rounded to 2 decimal places.
