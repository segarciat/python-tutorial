# 1. Practice: Circles

Create a script `circles.py` that does the following:

- Create a variable called `pi` with a value of `3.14`.
- Create a variable called `radius` set to `5`.
- Create a variable called `circumference` whose value is the circumference
a circle whose radius has the value of the `radius` variable.
- Create a variable called `circle_area` whose value is the area of a circle
whose radius has the value of the `radius` variable.
- Print the  values of `circumference` and `circle_area`.
