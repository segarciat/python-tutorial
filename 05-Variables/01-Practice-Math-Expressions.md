# 1. Practice: Math Expressions

Create a Python script called `math_expressions.py`. In it, do the following:

- Create a variable called `pi` with a value of `3.14`.
- Create a variable called `radius` set to `5`.
- Create a variable called `circumference` whose value is the circumference
a circle whose radius has the value of the `radius` variable.
- Create a variable called `circle_area` whose value is the area of a circle
whose radius has the value of the `radius` variable.
- Print the  values of `circumference` and `circle_area`.

Next, do the following:

- Create variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with values `1`, `7`, and `10`.
These represent the coefficients of a quadratic polynomial.
- Create a variable called `discriminant` whose value is the
[*discriminant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant) of the
polynomial represented by `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Create a variable called `x_plus` whose value is the result of applying
the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula).
The quadratic formula has a plus/minus symbol. Use the `+` for this one.
- Repeat the previous step, but now create a variable called `x_minus`.
This time, use the `-` in the plus/minus of the quadratic formula.
- Display the value of `x_plus` and `x_minus`.
