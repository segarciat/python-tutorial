# 01: Leap Year

Create a Python script `leap_year.py` and implement a Boolean function
`is_leap_year()` that accepts a single `int` argument that represents
a year. Return `True` if the year is a leap year, and `False` otherwise.
Validate the input to ensure it is a number that can be a valid year.
*Hint*: Use the built-in `type()` function to ensure the result is an
`int`, and check the year is not negative.
