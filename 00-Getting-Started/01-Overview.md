# 1. Overview

Welcome to my Python tutorial! My goal is to share my knowledge of computer programming
and computer science with you, using Python for concreteness. Python is a general-purpose
programming language that is versatile, and has found use in many areas, including:

- Web Development
- Machine Learning
- Scientific Computing
- Game Development

and much more. Before getting into Python, I believe it's useful to learn how to
interact with your *shell*, a program available on most computers with an operating
system. We will discuss the following:

- What is an operating system?
- What is a shell, and how does it relate to an operating system?
- How can we use the shell to install programs?
- How can we install Python?
- How can we install other tools to make coding in Python simpler?
