# 2. Operating System

In present days, most personal computers run an operating system. An [**operating system**](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) (or OS
for short) is a piece of software in a computer with many responsibilities. Most notably,
it is responsible for supervising the interaction between programs (such as internet browsers)
and our hardware (such as our keyboard, screen, and speakers). The OS manages the computer's
*memory* (RAM, or Random Access Memory) and *processes* (running instance of programs),
among other things. Operating systems are not our focus, but it's good to be aware of them.

The following are popular operating systems nowadays:

- **macOS**: The operating system in computers sold by Apple. In previous versions it was
also known as **OS X**. Some of the specific versions include **Sonoma** (released in 2023),
**Mojave** (released in 2018), **High Sierra** (2017), and **Sierra** (2016).

- **Windows**: Developed by Microsoft, and installed on many commercially available computers.
At the time of writing, Windows 11 is the latest available for home computers.

- **Ubuntu**: An open source operating system that uses the popular Linux kernel.

There are many other operating systems, including phone-specific operating systems like
*iOS* for Apple Devices and *Android* which is also based on Linux.

Many operating systems draw [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix), an operating
system developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s. As a result, there are programs commonly
found among them, but the one of interest to us is the *shell*.
